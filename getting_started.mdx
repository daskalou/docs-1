<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up">
    You can sign up [here](https://dashboard.vapi.ai) using the traditional method of email plus password or sign up using Google OAuth. Once you sign up, you will be redirected to the dashboard.

From the dashboard, you can create assistants, set up phone numbers, view your call history, and more.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a Payment Method">
    Once you hit $10 in usage, your API calls will start throwing "Over Billing Limit". So, it's best to add a payment method before you hit that limit. This can be done in the **Billing** page in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai).

    Once saved, you can increase your billing limit by increasing an amount in the **Billing Limit** field.

  </Step>
   <Step title="Use your API key">
    Your API key can be found in the **Account** page > Vapi Keys > Private API Key. When making requests to the API, make sure to include your key in the `Authorization` header.
    
    ```typescript
    const axios = require('axios');
    const API_KEY = 'your_api_key';

    const res = await axios.get('https://api.vapi.ai/assistant', {
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`
      }
    });

    console.log(res.data);
    ```

  </Step>
