## Installation Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the Widget Snippet">
    Copy the following snippet and paste it into the HTML of your website, preferably before the closing `</body>` tag.

    ```html
    <script>
      const assistant = "<assistant_id>"; // Replace with your assistant ID
      const apiKey = "<your_api_key>"; // Replace with your API key
      const buttonConfig = {}; // Customize this as needed

      (function (d, t) {
        var g = document.createElement(t),
          s = d.getElementsByTagName(t)[0];
        g.src =
          "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/VapiAI/vapi-support-sdk/dist/assets/index.js";
        g.defer = true;
        g.async = true;
        s.parentNode.insertBefore(g, s);

        g.onload = function () {
          window.vapiSDK.run({
            apiKey: "", // required
            assistant: assistant, // required
            config: buttonConfig, // optional
          });
        };
      })(document, "script");
    </script>
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Your Assistant">
    From your Vapi dashboard, create an assistant to obtain the assistant ID. Alternatively, define an assistant configuration directly in your website's code as shown in the example below.
    ```javascript
    const assistant = {
      model: {
        provider: "openai",
        model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
        systemPrompt:
          "You're a versatile AI assistant named Vapi who is fun to talk with.",
      },
      voice: {
        provider: "11labs",
        voiceId: "paula",
      },
      firstMessage: "Hi, I am Vapi how can I assist you today?",
    };
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize the Button">
    Adjust the `buttonConfig` object to match your website's style and branding. Choose between a pill or round button and set colors, positions, and icons.
    ```javascript
    const buttonConfig = {
      position: "bottom-right", // "bottom" | "top" | "left" | "right" | "top-right" | "top-left" | "bottom-left" | "bottom-right"
      offset: "40px", // decide how far the button should be from the edge
      width: "50px", // min-width of the button
      height: "50px", // height of the button
      idle: { // button state when the call is not active.
        color: `rgb(93, 254, 202)`, 
        type: "pill", // or "round"
        title: "Have a quick question?", // only required in case of Pill
        subtitle: "Talk with our AI assistant", // only required in case of pill
        icon: `https://unpkg.com/lucide-static@0.321.0/icons/phone.svg`,
      },
      loading: { // button state when the call is connecting
        color: `rgb(93, 124, 202)`,
        type: "pill", // or "round"
        title: "Connecting...", // only required in case of Pill
        subtitle: "Please wait", // only required in case of pill
        icon: `https://unpkg.com/lucide-static@0.321.0/icons/loader-2.svg`,
      },
      active: { // button state when the call is in progress or active.
        color: `rgb(255, 0, 0)`,
        type: "pill", // or "round"
        title: "Call is in progress...", // only required in case of Pill
        subtitle: "End the call.", // only required in case of pill
        icon: `https://unpkg.com/lucide-static@0.321.0/icons/phone-off.svg`,
      },
    };
