By Default Vapi records your calls, logs or transcriptions for the purpose of improving the quality of the service. At the same time we respect your privacy and so you can opt-out by choosing HIPAA Compliance. This does have its own drawback in the sense that you will not be able to access the logs, recordings or transcriptions of the call.

## HIPAA Compliance with Vapi

When using Vapi's voice assistant platform, you can ensure HIPAA compliance by leveraging the `hipaaEnabled` configuration in the assistant settings.

By setting `hipaaEnabled` to true in the assistant configuration, you can guarantee that no logs, recordings, or transcriptions will be stored during the call. However, at the end of the call, an end-of-call-report message will still be generated for storage on your server.

It's important to note that the default value for `hipaaEnabled` is false. To enable HIPAA compliance, simply set this configuration to true when creating your assistant.

By following these guidelines, you can maintain HIPAA compliance while utilizing Vapi's voice assistant platform for your business needs.
