<Card title="Voice AI Pricing That's Flexible and Transparent">
The speech-to-speech pipeline on our platform consists of three components: Transcription, Model, and Voice. These are offered by various service providers. As part of the advantage to using Vapi, we have integrated this pipeline into our platform so you don’t have to worry about assembling or building it yourself. 
<br />
We bill you for the Transcription and Voice services **at cost**. If you choose to go with a LLM we offer through the platform, you will be billed for the Model **at cost**. <Info>Or, you can use your own custom LLM and not pay anything for the Model.</Info> 
<Info>You also have the option of using [Provider Keys](/provider_keys); if you use a Provider Key for Transcription, Model, or Voice, you are not charged through the Vapi platform but are billed directly by the provider.</Info> 
**On top of what you are billed for providers (again, only at cost and with exceptions for custom LLMs and Provider Keys), Vapi charges a base fee of $0.05 per minute.** 
<br />
Below, we have **estimates** of provider costs per minute. There are also two pricing examples to illustrate how this comes together.
</Card>

<Accordion title="Billing">
Billing occurs automatically based on the cost of the providers you choose. The only exception is for [Provider Keys](/provider_keys). When you use a Provider Key, you will be billed directly by the provider. <b /> You can find your usage and billing information in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.vapi.ai).

The provider costs listed below are subject to change as we get more data, but they will always reflect our best estimate of the provider costs per minute.

<Accordion title="Pricing Example 1">
I want to use Vapi voice assistants to support my human customer service reps in a call center. However, I have a custom LLM I would prefer to use instead of the ones offered through the platform. Expected monthly usage will be 10,000 minutes, with an average of 2 minutes per call. For Voice, PlayHT will suit our needs. What is my pricing breakdown? 
<br />
Transcription costs will be 0.01 per min. Since you will be using a custom LLM, there will be no charge for the Model. PlayHT for Voice will be 0.10 per minute. The Vapi base fee for using the platform will be 0.05 per minute. Here is your breakdown: 
<br />
(Vapi: \$0.05 x 10000 x 2) + (Deepgram: \$0.01 x 10000 x 2) + (Model: \$0.00) + (PlayHT: \$0.10 x 10000 x 2) <br /> Total cost per month to use the Vapi platform: $3,200
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Pricing Example 2">
I have a company that does real estate lead generation, and would like to use Vapi voice assistants to automate parts of my customer support process. These support calls would average 4.5 minutes a call. For Model I want to use ChatGPT-3.5-turbo through your platform, and for Voice I will be using a Provider Key. I’d like a breakdown based on getting 100 inbound calls in one month.  
<br />
Transcription costs will be 0.01 per min. For the Model, ChatGPT-3.5-turbo will be 0.02 per minute. Since for Voice you will be using a Provider Key, you will be billed directly by that provider and there will be no charge from Vapi. The Vapi base fee for using the platform will be 0.05 per minute. Here is your breakdown:  
<br />
(Vapi: \$0.05 x 100 x 4.5) + (Deepgram: \$0.01 x 100 x 4.5) + (Model: \$0.02 x 100 x 4.5) + (Voice: \$0.00) <br /> Total cost per month to use the Vapi platform: $36
