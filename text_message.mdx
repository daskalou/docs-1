description: "As a developer, you might encounter situations where silently updating the chat history is necessary; this is particularly  true for background tasks or discreetly logging user interactions. Vapi SDK simplifies this process with efficient text message integration."

## Scenario Overview

Imagine a scenario where a user action, such as pressing a button, needs to be logged in the chat history without overt user involvement. This might be crucial for maintaining conversation context or for system logging purposes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a Button to Trigger the Message">
    Add a button to your interface with an `onClick` event handler that will call a function to send the system message:
    ```html
    <button id="log-action" onClick="logUserAction()">Log Action</button>
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Log the Action as a System Message">
    When the button is clicked, the `logUserAction` function will silently insert a system message into the chat history:
    ```js
    function logUserAction() {
      // Function to log the user action
      vapi.send({
        type: "add-message",
        message: {
          role: "system",
          content: "The user has pressed the button, say peanuts",
        },
      });
    }
    ```
    - `vapi.send`: The primary function to interact with your assistant, handling various requests or commands.
    - `type: "add-message"`: Specifies the command to add a new message.
    - `message`: This is the actual message that you want to add to the message history.
      - `role`: "system" Designates the message origin as 'system', ensuring the addition is unobtrusive. Other possible values of role are 'user' | 'assistant' | 'tool' | 'function'
      - `content`: The actual message text to be added.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Conclusion

The Vapi SDK, with its dual capabilities in voice and text interactions, is an invaluable asset for developers. Leveraging its text messaging feature not only diversifies interaction modes, but also enriches the overall functionality and user experience of voice assistant applications.
